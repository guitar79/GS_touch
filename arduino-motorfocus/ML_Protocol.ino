Serial Commands: 
All commands are preceded by a “:” symbol and 
finished with a “#” symbol. “x” represents a 
hexadecimal digit.

Example: To set a new position: :SN0537#
For motor 2 all of the above commands are available, just precede the command with a “2”.
Motor 2 Example: To set Motor 2 to a new position: :2SN0537#

Generic serial commands can be used to operate the controllers if needed. 
Please see table below for command set.

Command Char #        Return Variable         Comments
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
: C #                 N/A                     
Initiate a temperature conversion; the conversion process takes a maximum of 750 milliseconds. The value returned by the :GT# command will not be valid until the conversion process completes.

: F G #               N/A 
Go to the new position as set by the ":SNYYYY#" command.

: F Q #               N/A 
Immediately stop any focus motor movement.

: G C #               XX# 
Returns the temperature coefficient where XX is a two-digit signed (2’s complement) hex number.

: G D #               XX# 
Returns the current stepping delay where XX is a two-digit unsigned hex number. See the :SD# command for a list of possible return values.

: G H #               00# OR FF# 
Returns "FF#" if the focus motor is half-stepped otherwise return "00#"

: G I #               00# OR 01# 
Returns "00#" if the focus motor is not moving, otherwise return "01#"

: G N #               YYYY# 
Returns the new position previously set by a ":SNYYYY" command where YYYY is a four-digit unsigned hex number.

: G P #               YYYY# 
Returns the current position where YYYY is a four-digit unsigned hex number.

: G T #               YYYY# 
Returns the current temperature where YYYY is a four-digit signed (2’s complement) hex number.

: G V #               DD# 
Get the version of the firmware as a two-digit decimal number where the first digit is the major version number, and the second digit is the minor version number.

: S C X X #           N/A 
Set the new temperature coefficient where XX is a two-digit, signed (2’s complement) hex number.

: S D X X #           N/A 
Set the new stepping delay where XX is a two-digit, unsigned hex number. Valid values to send are 02, 04, 08, 10 and 20, which correspond to a stepping delay of 250, 125, 63, 32 and 16 steps per second respectively.

: S F #               N/A 
Set full-step mode.

: S H #               N/A 
Set half-step mode.

: S N Y Y Y Y #       N/A 
Set the new position where YYYY is a four-digit unsigned hex number.

: S P Y Y Y Y #       N/A 
Set the current position where YYYY is a four-digit unsigned hex number.

: + #                 N/A 
Activate temperature compensation focusing.

: - #                 N/A 
Disable temperature compensation focusing.

: P O X X #           N/A 
Temperature calibration offset, XX is a two-digit signed hex number, in half degree increments. 
Example 1: :PO02# offset of +1°C  
Example 2: :POFB# offset of -2.5°C
